# Sudoku_Game_Project
C++ Sudoku Validity Checker Project Using Discrete Mathematics Concepts.

This is a simple C++ program to check moves in a Sudoku game.
The program shows a Sudoku board, takes input from the user, and checks if the number can be placed in the chosen row and column.
It makes sure numbers do not repeat in the same row, column, or 3×3 grid.
This project uses basic programming and logic concepts to make Sudoku easier to play.
